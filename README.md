# Waste Classification 
<p>This project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for automated waste material classification in waste management systems from images.
	 The primary objective is to optimize the architecture, training parameters, 
	 and hyperparameters of convolutional neural network (CNN) models to achieve high accuracy while minimizing the risk of overfitting.
	  By automating waste classification, the models contribute to reducing waste pollution and improving recycling practices. </p>
